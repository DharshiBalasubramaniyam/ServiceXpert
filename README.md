Building secure web applications is a critical skill in today’s world, where data breaches and vulnerabilities are frequent. In this project, I developed a Vehicle Service Reservation System as part of a “Information security” course. The key focus of this project was to ensure the security of the application by adhering to the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities while providing a seamless user experience for reserving vehicle services.

The web application is built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf as the backend and frontend frameworks. For authentication, I integrated Auth0, which utilizes the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol to securely manage user identities. The application also implements secure access control to ensure that users can only access and manage their own vehicle service reservations.
